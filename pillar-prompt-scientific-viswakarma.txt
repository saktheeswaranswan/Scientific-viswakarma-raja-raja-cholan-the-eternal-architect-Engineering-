A sweeping, ultra-wide banner-size cinematic diptych set on a broad, golden-sand riverbank under a bright, cloud-dappled sky at high noon. On the left panel (‘Before’), an ornately dressed Chola-dynasty king in gleaming gold jewelry and rich silk dhoti stands solemnly at the water’s edge, gazing down at a transparent wooden-framed glass box filled nearly to the brim with fine, pale-yellow sand. Within the sand lies a stout, blood-red cylindrical pillar, buried horizontally along the top surface. In the lower right corner of the box’s front face is a small, square mini-door—closed and flush with the wood—hinting at a hidden mechanism. Behind the king, the wide, gently flowing Cauvery River reflects the azure sky, and in the distant background rises an unfinished Dravidian temple tower, its sandstone gopuram just visible through the verdant riverside palms.

On the right panel (‘After’), everything remains in the same epic setting—same riverbank, same tropical foliage, same temple silhouette—but time has advanced. The mini-door at the base of the box is now ajar, and a slender stream of sand trickles steadily out onto the ground. Inside, the red pillar has shifted and now stands upright, propped by the remaining sand, its glossy surface catching the sunlight. The king’s expression has subtly changed: his gaze is firmer, his stance more assured, as if witnessing the completion of a mighty ritual or experiment. Scattered grains of sand form a small dune at the box’s exit, emphasizing motion and transformation.

Both panels feature hyper-realistic, extreme detailing: individual sand granules glinting in the sun, lifelike skin texture on the king’s arms and chest, intricate gold filigree on his crown and necklace, and crisp reflections on the glass panes of the box. The lighting is bright and warm, as though shot on a top-of-the-line DSLR with a wide-angle lens—strong highlights on metallic surfaces, soft natural shadows on the sand, and a slight depth-of-field that keeps the king and box tack-sharp while gently blurring the distant temple and trees. The overall color palette is golden-hour vibrant: the sand glows with soft yellow tones, the pillar stands out in a rich red, the king’s attire shines in warm golds and earthy browns, and the sky is a vivid cerulean with fluffy, backlit clouds.

Compose both scenes side by side with a narrow white divider; maintain perfect symmetry in framing so the box and king align across the diptych. Emphasize the narrative shift from stasis to motion, from potential energy stored in the horizontal pillar to kinetic release as the pillar rises and sand pours out. The final result should evoke a sense of ancient royalty meeting precise, almost scientific transformation, tying together history, ritual, and physics in one sweeping cinematic collage.
